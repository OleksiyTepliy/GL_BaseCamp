I wrote a program that calculates ## determinant of sqare matrix
It consist of 2 source files:
1. *main.c*
2. *det.c.*
In *main.c* is 2 options witch can be selected by commenting related *#define* statement.
It allow us to choose whitch test nedded to be run.
* ##define**command_line_argument_test** solves the actual problem
* ##define**random_test** used for taking measurments.
